# ASSIGNMENT 3: LOCKER

Its aims were to:

- Manipulate file locks
- Understand various types of locks

Due to the technical difficulty of not knowing how to ƃuᴉʞɹoɟ code, aka. how to code `fork()` stuff, we have devised a way for this to work, and it's quite simple:

- You run the program from 2 shells (with the same `<somefile>` of course).
- And it should work.

## Run

```bash
make
./locker <somefile>
```
